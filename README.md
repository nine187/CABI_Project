*Created: May 2023*

This is the repository of the work attempted by Pasith Prayoonrat on the project regarding the modelling of aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus as a dissertation for the Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution course at Imperial College and the Centre for Agricultural and Bioscience International (CABI).
## Table of Contents
1. Code - containing R codes used during the project
2. Data - files required to run the scripts
3. Result - maps and data (mostly are images data which are too big to upload to github)
